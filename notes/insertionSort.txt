Insertion Sort

    Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.
    In other words, we are taking an element one at a time and inserting it in the correct spot

    Example:

    // Initial unsorted array
    [5️⃣, ③, 4, 1, 2]

    // Take the first element (3️⃣) and insert it in the correct spot in the sorted section
    [3️⃣,5️⃣, ④, 1, 2]

    // Take the next element (④) and insert it in the correct spot in the sorted section
    [3️⃣, 4️⃣, 5️⃣, ①, 2]

    // Take the next element (①) and insert it in the correct spot in the sorted section
    [1️⃣, 3️⃣, 4️⃣, 5️⃣, ②]

    // Take the final element (②) and insert it in the correct spot in the sorted section
    [1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, 4️⃣, 5️⃣]
