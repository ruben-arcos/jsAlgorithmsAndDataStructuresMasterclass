Quick Sort
* Easiest to solve through recursion where we keep 
   basically splitting up the data, the array until we 
   hit arrays that are zero or one long, which means 
   that they are individually sorted       

* Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 and 1 
   element are always sorted
* Works by selecting one element (called the 'pivot') 
   and finding the index where the pivot should end up 
   it the sorted array
* Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort 
  can be applied on either side of the pivot
