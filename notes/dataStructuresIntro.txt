Data Structures
- What they have in common is that they are collections of values.

What do they do?
Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, 
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

Why so many?
Different data structures excel at different things. some are highly 
specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generaly used

Why care?
The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to 
use one of these data structures
