What is sorting?

Sorting is the process or rearranging the 
items in a collection (e.g. an array) so 
that the items are in some kind of order

Examples:
* Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
* Sorting names alphabetically
* Sorting movies based on release year
* Sorting movies based on revenue

        function sort(arr) {
            return arr
        }

        console.log(sort([23,45,6,12,13])) // [6,12,13,23,45]

Why do we need to learn this?

* Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's
good to know how it works
* There are many different ways to sort things,
and different techniques have their own 
advantages and disadvantages
* Classic interview topic. Good for critical thinking
