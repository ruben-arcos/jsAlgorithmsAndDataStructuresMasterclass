Doubly Linked Lists

●Still a length list. There is no indexing
● Basically, all that we do is add a pointer to the previous node 
   and the next node so each node points in two directions.
● ALMOST identical to Singly Linked List, except every node 
   has ANOTHER pointer, to the PREVIOUS node

Objectives:
● Construct a Doubly Linked List
● Compare and contrast Doubly and Singly Linked Lists
● Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List

Comparisons wirh Singly Linked Lists
More flexibility === More memory
