Naive String Search

* Suppose you want to count the number of times a smaller string appears in a longer string
* A straightforward approach involves checking pairs of characters individually

Imagine we have this string
'Harold said haha in Hamburg'

If we were searching for the letter 'i' can be done with linear search

Example:
 Long string:                        Short string:
 wowomgzomg                    omg
                 omg
